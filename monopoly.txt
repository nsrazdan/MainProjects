I made a fully functional CLI version of monopoly that used unique file inputs to determine the board and the rules
It is able to support as many players as you could want
The project was 3000 or so lines of code at its completion, with a number of ideas for further implemenatation and with the code well organized
Sadly, the project was lost
However, it gave me plentiful experience in OOP, functional programming, and projects of scale
